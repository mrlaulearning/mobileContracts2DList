# mobileContracts2DList
Boilerplate and Finished program to demonstrate skills in file writing and reading using 2D Lists

I recorded my live coding of this solution here: https://youtu.be/JunQkIJneKk It's a little over an hour and shows the full process including lots of mistakes and problem solving.
